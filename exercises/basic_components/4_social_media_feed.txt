Question 4: Build a Social Media Feed

Develop a mobile social media feed using Ionic-React. The layout should include the following components:

- Cards representing posts, each containing the user's profile picture, username, post content, and a "Like" button.
- Use a responsive grid to display additional media content (images or videos) related to some posts.
- Include a "Comment" button for users to add comments to posts.
- Ensure the layout is clean, organized, and responsive.
