Question 1: Design a Mobile Profile Page

Imagine you are developing a mobile profile page using Ionic-React. Design a layout that includes the following elements:

- User's profile picture (use an Ionic card for styling).
- User's name and a brief bio.
- A list of favorite hobbies displayed as Ionic buttons.
- A responsive grid for showcasing the user's photo gallery (at least three photos).
- Ensure that the layout is visually appealing and responsive. Utilize appropriate Ionic components for buttons, cards, and responsive grid.
