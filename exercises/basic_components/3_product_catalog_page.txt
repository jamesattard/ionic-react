Question 3: Create a Product Catalog Page

Design a mobile product catalog page using Ionic-React. The layout should include the following elements:

- A list of product cards, each containing the product image, name, price, and a "View Details" button.
- Use a responsive grid to showcase product categories, with at least three categories.
- Include a "Filter" button for users to filter products based on categories.
- Ensure the layout is visually appealing and responsive.
