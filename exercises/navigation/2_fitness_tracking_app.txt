Question 2: Fitness Tracking App

Create an engaging fitness tracking app using Ionic-React with the following structure:

1. Welcome Screen:

  - Display a welcome message to users starting their fitness journey.
  - Include a "Get Started" button to navigate to the workout tracking screen.

2. Workout Tracking:

  - On tapping "Get Started" on the Welcome Screen, users should be directed to the Workout Tracking screen.
  - Display workout tracking features, including exercise logs and progress charts, using cards with images fetched from a stock image website.
  - Use tabs for easy navigation between the Welcome and Workout Tracking screens.
